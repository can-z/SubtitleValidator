Hammersmith, these are my friends.

Charmed. Richard.

00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:15,999

Richard. Fine name. I had a horse called Richard. And you are?

42
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,151

Hunter. As I live, breathe and defecate, it is.

Hammersmith.

Hammersmith, can you bring me down? Beg pardon, Lady.

45
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,044

Now, what can I do for you?

46
00:04:35,044 --> 00:04:38,591

Couple of things. Richard, I've got a mission for you.

47
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,053
×ÖÄ»
For me? For you and Hunter.

48
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,486
×ÖÄ»
Who are they? Sewer Folk.

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,701

Important mission. Honestly.

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,440

What kind of meat is it, then?

00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:32,294

Crow. Ah, right.

52
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:38,064

Do you have something we could carry them with?

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,997

Oh. What do you do?

62
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:15,382

When I'm not looking for food, I'm a guide.

63
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,450

I know every inch of the Underside.

64
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,932

00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,963

I've felt better.

76
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:45,365

What do you want to go and get yourself killed for, anyway?

77
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:47,782
×ÖÄ»
That's what I want to know. Information.

78
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,498
×ÖÄ»
People tell you so much more 

79
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:51,851
×ÖÄ»
When they know you're about to be dead,

80
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:54,915
×ÖÄ»
and then they talk around you when you are.

81
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,282
×ÖÄ»
What's it like, then?

82
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,250
×ÖÄ»
Being dead?

83
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,080
×ÖÄ»
Live long enough and you'll find out for yourself.

84
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:11,125
×ÖÄ»
It's very cold, my friend. Very dark and very cold.

85
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:19,763

Fine work, hammersmith. Thank you, Lady.

86
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,556
×ÖÄ»
What do you want in return?

87
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:34,150
×ÖÄ»
It's a puzzle box.

88
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,135
×ÖÄ»
I took it in exchange for some smithing a handful of years ago.

89
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:39,156
×ÖÄ»
I can't get it open.

90
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,531

I was hoping it would be diamonds and pearls.

91
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,055
×ÖÄ»
He's got pretty eyes, Hammersmith.

92
00:09:54,055 --> 00:09:56,477
×ÖÄ»
Keep him, he'll bring you luck.

93
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,960

This is Lamia. She's a guide.

96
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,800

She says she can take us anywhere in the Underside.

97
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,856

Anywhere? Anywhere.

98
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:12,654

Do you know where the Angel Islington is?

99
00:10:13,206 --> 00:10:17,325
×ÖÄ»
Islington? You can't go there. Do you know?

100
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,738
×ÖÄ»
Down Street. The end of Down Street, but it's not safe.

101
00:10:23,738 --> 00:10:26,463
×ÖÄ»
We don't need a guide.

102
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:30,503
×ÖÄ»
Well, I think that we do. The Marquis still hasn't shown up.

103
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:34,009
×ÖÄ»
We know it's gonna be a dangerous journey.

104
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,319
×ÖÄ»
We've got to get the thing that I got to the Angel.

105
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:38,350
×ÖÄ»
And then he'll tell Door about her family,

106
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,186
×ÖÄ»
And he'll tell me how to get home.

107
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:43,887
×ÖÄ»
And he'll give you brains, and me a heart.

108
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:45,800
×ÖÄ»
We'll be fine, just the three of us, Richard.

109
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,300
×ÖÄ»
You just don't like it that I'm sorting everything out for once,

110
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,735
×ÖÄ»
Instead of following blindly behind you, going where I'm told.

111
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,818
×ÖÄ»
Do you know where Down Street is?  -Yes, Lady.

112
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,918
×ÖÄ»
Right.

113
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,686
×ÖÄ»
It says, "The Royal Society

Down Street. Please knock."

116
00:11:13,136 --> 00:11:15,700
×ÖÄ»
Ah, you get to the street through the house.

117
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,184
×ÖÄ»
No. The street's in the house.

118
00:11:20,242 --> 00:11:23,316
×ÖÄ»
Ah, the street's in the house.

119
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,612
×ÖÄ»
Now would be a bad time to discover that 

120
00:12:04,612 --> 00:12:06,788
×ÖÄ»
I was a claustrophobic, wouldn't it?

121
00:12:06,788 --> 00:12:08,312
×ÖÄ»
Yep.

122
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,684
×ÖÄ»
Then I won't.
